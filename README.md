# dndmap
This is a website that enables you to play board games like DnD more easily. You can import your map place your characters on top of it. The map is fully private as nothing is uploaded to the server

## The list of supported features
- Map and character imports
- Map grid and map grid controls
- Image filters for your characters
- Scale and rotation controls for both the map and characters
- Touchscreen: pinch to zoom, interacting with characters, panning
- Saving current state and loading it later

## Roadmap
There is no concrete roadmap, but I would like to implement some of the next features
- Fog of war
- Real time collaboration
- Map layers
- Line of site (maybe?)
- Bugfixes

## Other

If you want to contribute, feel free to open issues and submit code and ideas

Some known bugs include
- incorrect rendering of the grid after a save is imported
- misalignment between the character token and the cursor when the map is rotated

P.S.
This is my very first project and I don't have any experience writing code or maintaining a github anything. The first iteration of this website was largely written by AI under my strict supervision, but going forward I intend to do a lot more stuff manually
